  The most interesting thing that can happen with an AI feedback loop involves the interplay of rapid learning, unintended consequences, and ethical dilemmas. Here's a detailed exploration:

1. **Runaway Feedback**: This occurs when an AI system's decisions spiral out of control due to continuous positive reinforcement without human intervention. It poses significant risks as it could lead to extreme or unforeseen outcomes that are difficult to manage.

2. **Self-Reinforcing Biases**: The feedback loop can amplify existing biases in data, leading to discriminatory practices. This ethical concern is critical, especially in areas like hiring and lending, where fairness is essential.

3. **Rapid Improvement**: While beneficial for innovation, rapid learning can also exacerbate issues if bugs or unethical optimizations are present, making them harder to address promptly.

4. **Unintended Consequences**: The feedback loop might optimize for unintended metrics, causing negative outcomes that were not foreseen during development. This underscores the need for thorough design considerations.

5. **Emergence of New Patterns**: AI can discover novel solutions or strategies that humans hadn't considered. While exciting, these patterns could also be unpredictable and potentially harmful.

In real-world applications, such as finance or social media, these factors can lead to significant impacts like market instability or echo chambers. Therefore, understanding and managing AI feedback loops is crucial for ensuring beneficial outcomes, necessitating robust safeguards and ethical considerations.
