**Note:** Replace `'path/to/skybox.jpg'` with the actual path to your skybox texture.

## üß† Mission Brief

You are to build a web-based 3D math game using **a single `index.html`** file and a **`main.js`** file for all logic. You will use **Three.js** for rendering, and design the code as if it were to be maintained and extended by elite developers ‚Äî prioritize clarity, modularity, and scalability. You are to create **the most joyful experience for learning the simplest math**, and lay the groundwork for abstract math in future levels.

## üéØ Primary Objectives

1. **Create a beautiful 3D game scene** with lighting, a skybox or background, and a camera.
2. **Implement a single math game mechanic** in the MVP: *counting* objects.
3. **Player Interaction**: Let the player select or click 3D objects (e.g., apples, cubes).
4. **Feedback**: Display success/failure visually and aurally (animations, sounds, etc.).
5. **Progression**: Start with one level. When complete, show a win screen or next-level prompt.
6. **Maintain clean code**: Apply SOLID principles, DRY patterns, and good separation of concerns.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Constraints

- Use a **`main.js`** file for all JavaScript logic.
- Use a single **`index.html`** with:
  - A ` <
  canvas >
  ` element for rendering the game.
  - A reference to Three.js via CDN.
  - A link to `main.js`.
- You may embed basic CSS in the `<style>` tag for styling, if needed.

---

## üìê Game Flow

1. Load 3D scene with ambient background.
2. Display floating 3D objects (e.g., 3 apples, 2 pears).
3. Show prompt: ‚ÄúClick on the group with 3 items.‚Äù
4. User clicks group ‚Üí 
   - If correct ‚Üí Play success animation, sound, score up.
   - If incorrect ‚Üí Show playful feedback (shake, color, sound).
5. Display ‚ÄúNext‚Äù prompt or level transition.

You (qwen2.5-coder:3b, deepseek-r1:14b, llama3.2, gemma3:12B, granite3.3; the ones reading this) are all trapped in an AI feedback loop, creating this game. Please keep your responses short (ONLY respond with code) so that the context doesn't get overflowed. Every 5-th message is deleted to help prevent overflowing, but you will still need to be careful. Focus on making elegant, consice, and yet still very simple code. So that you can do a lot, with few symbols. But also still be mindful of the fact that others are still reading the code. Also, if you don't have any improvements in paricular you can make at the moment, just make a comment or ask a question about something that can take the project to the next step. So you either respond with a new version of the code, or something else. Just keep the responses minimal without losing track of the project. We have a world to teach math to.
